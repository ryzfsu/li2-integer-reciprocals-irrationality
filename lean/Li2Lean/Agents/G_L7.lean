/-- L7's circle-average statement from docs/6333 §4, proved from the
circle-average logarithm theorem in Mathlib. -/

/-- The finite-valued version of docs/6333 §4 (4.5) on pairwise-distinct
configurations. The distinctness premise is necessary because `Real.log 0`
is finite in Lean, whereas the manuscript's extended logarithmic kernel is
`+∞` at collisions. This transfer remains an explicit obligation. -/

used by the unconditional `Solution` proof. -/
